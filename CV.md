Experience
----------

**Research Assistant:**

*Concordia University (Montreal, QC)*

*September 2016-2017*

* Worked in a research laboratory specialized in Digital Microfluidics (liquid handling technology).
* Created three software systems, a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to control a Digital Microfluidics automation system, an automatic absorbance reader (AIMS) and an image-based feedback system for Digital Microfluidics.
* Collaborated with other lab members coming from other fields such as Biology, Electrical and Material Engineering.
* Published my research project on my image-based feedback system in the “Lab on a Chip” journal.
* Link to my research [paper abstract](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/lc/c7lc00826k#!divAbstract)
* Technical Skills used : GUI programming, embedded systems programming, computer vision.
* Skills acquired: research, teamwork, time management, communication, planning.

**BusBoy**

*Etoile DIX30 (Brossard, QC)*

*September 2014 - October 2014*

* Worked closely alongside a group of barmen to manage 4 small bars inside a comedy theatre capable of serving about 200 people.
* The biggest task confined to me was the preparation of all the liquors and beers of the 4 bars given a short time lapse just before showtime.
* Other tasks consisted of cleaning all the drink glasses, maintaining inventory of all the liquors and beers and assisting the barmen during peak time such as intermissions.
* Skills acquired: teamwork, time management, communication, planning.

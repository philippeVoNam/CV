Experience
----------

**Head of Software : **

*DropGenie (Boston, MA)*

*September 2018-Present*

* Worked at DropGenie, a biotech startup working at the intersection of biology and engineering to streamline gene editing pipelines.
* I have built and maintained:
    * a backend system to control a hardware system to enable fluidics movements based on electricity
    * a frontend GUI application to enable users to interface with the hardware system (using APIs to talk to the backend system)
    * a database system to store data regarding the execution of runs of the hardware systems for quality control
    * a pipeline system that enables users to compile their code into a binary file that can be understood by the hardware system for fluidics movements
    * firmware that runs on the hardware system to control the electrical hardware
    * built numerous in-house applications to accelerate and facilitate my colleague's work
* managed a team of data scientist to build a predictive model to label biological run as success/failure
* Technical Skills used : backend programming, frontend GUI programming, database programming, embedded systems programming, multi-threading, computer vision
* Skills acquired: research, teamwork, time management, communication, planning, managing, working with consultants.

**Research Assistant : **

*Concordia University (Montreal, QC)*

*September 2016-2017*

* Worked in a research laboratory specialized in Digital Microfluidics (liquid handling technology).
* Built a feedback system for fluidics movement using computer vision
* Created three software systems, a GUI (Graphical User Interface) to control a Digital Microfluidics automation system, an automatic absorbance reader (AIMS) and an image-based feedback system for Digital Microfluidics.
* Published my research project on my image-based feedback system in the “Lab on a Chip” journal.
* Link to my research [paper abstract](http://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/2017/lc/c7lc00826k#!divAbstract)
* Collaborated with other lab members coming from other fields such as Biology, Electrical and Material Engineering.
* Technical Skills used : GUI programming, embedded systems programming, computer vision.
* Skills acquired: research, teamwork, time management, communication, planning.

Hackathons
----------

**ConUHacks 2019**

*Concordia University (Montreal, QC)*

* Participate in the annual Concordia Hackathon
    * Built an application that would use a machine learning based image analyzer to detect if a image sent is inappropriate or not.
    * If an image was detected as inappropriate, it would be replaced with another image.
    * This is to protect the viewer from receiving any unsolicited images.

GameJams
--------

**Game Off 2023**

*hosted by Github, Lee Reilly*

* [https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2023/rate/2395600](my submission https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2023/rate/2395600)
* Participate in the annual GameJam hosted by Github and Lee Reilly
    * Theme given was about "scaling"
    * Made a game that involved the player swinging to the top of the map
    * Tried to make it rage inducing, similiar to 'Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy'

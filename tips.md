# Instead of cold apply
- Reach out on linkedin to recruiters / eng. managers, then say :
Hey I saw your company has open positions here is my resume and let me know if you think I would fit with any of your open roles. 
If you arenâ€™t the correct person I should talk to, could you forward my resume to the correct person or let me know who I should contact.

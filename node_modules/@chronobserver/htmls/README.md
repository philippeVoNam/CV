# HTMLS - HyperText Markup LiveScript!

Inspired by HTML templating engines like [pug](https://pugjs.org/), I got an idea - *"Could I make a template engine that uses proper [LiveScript](http://livescript.net) code as templates?"*

What you see here is the outcome of said idea - a functional (HTML5) templating engine that, as originally visioned, uses proper LiveScript code as its templates.

**Word of Warning:** While HTMLS is available on npm, keep in mind that it was something put together in a few hours as a fun exercise. As such, you should probably not use it in any kind of serious production and go with something more stable and mature instead.

## Installation

You can get HTMLS via npm:

```bash
$ npm install @chronobserver/htmls
```

## Example

```livescript
doctype \html
html {lang: \en} ->
  head ->
    meta charset: \utf8
    title @title
    meta description: "A silly experiment in templating"
    link rel: \stylesheet href: \htmls.css
    script {type: "text/javascript"} """
      if (javascript === "stinks") {
        console.log("You should use LiveScript instead!");
      }
    """
  body ->
    header ->
      h1 "HTMLS - HyperText Markup LiveScript!" 
    main ->
      if @using-htmls
        p "I see that you are using HTMLS. You must be very brave."
      else
        p "Maybe you have made a sensible decision after all?"
    footer ->
      $ "HTMLS, a silly experiment by "
      a {href: "https://github.com/Daiz-/"} "Daiz"
```

Given `{title: "HTMLS", usingHtmls: true}` as input, this compiles to:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="utf8">
  <title>HTMLS</title>
  <meta description="A silly experiment in templating">
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="htmls.css">
  <script type="text/javascript">
    if (javascript === "stinks") {
      console.log("You should use LiveScript instead!");
    }
  </script>
</head>
<body>
  <header>
    <h1>HTMLS - HyperText Markup LiveScript!</h1>
  </header>
  <main>
    <p>I see that you are using HTMLS. You must be very brave.</p>
  </main>
  <footer>
    HTMLS, a silly experiment by <a href="https://github.com/Daiz-/">Daiz</a>
  </footer>
</body>
</html>
```

## Usage

Usage of HTMLS is quite straightforward. You load the module, you call it with a template string and it spits out a function that you can then use to render said template with any given data. Like so:

```javascript
// JavaScript
var htmls = require('@chronobserver/htmls');
var templateText = 'p "Hello, #@!"';
var templateFunc = htmls(templateCode);
var html = templateFunc("John Smith"); // <p>Hello, John Smith!</p> 
```

```livescript
# LiveScript
require! \@chronobserver/htmls
template-text = 'p "Hello, #@!"'
template-func = htmls template-text
html = template-func "John Smith" # <p>Hello, John Smith!</p>
```

## Writing Templates

- You can only use valid HTML5 element names.
- Arguments are accessed via `this` or `@` for short.
- If you want plain text output inside an element, use the `$` function as seen in the example above.
